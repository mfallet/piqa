## piqa stands for "Parse, Injest, Query, Analzye" and is intended
## as a program that can peform all four functions in one stand-alone,
## c compiled program.  Starting with a simple input file (of which many
## are planned to be supported), piqa will parse the necessary data 
## (agnostically), injest the format into a cloud supported query system
## and analyze the data based on trends during the query.

## getting piqa:



## Making piqa FROM CLEAN GITHUB PULL:

Linux:
  # edit the configure.ac file and use autotools to generate a new configure script if there are any necessary changes
  # automake generates a makefile based on the Makefile.am program.  Edit Makefile.am AT YOUR OWN RISK
$ aclocal
$ autoconf
$ automake --add-missing
  # run configure and make
$ ./configure
$ make all
$ make install # not necessary in the first iteration, will do more later

## Cleaning piqa:

$ make clean
$ make distclean # removes all trace of the package, MUST start with configure script again.
